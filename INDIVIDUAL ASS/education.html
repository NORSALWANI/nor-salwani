          Now, I am studying Degree as I mention at my biodata. <br>
          Forth semester of Degree. <br>
          It is though and not easy because of the pandemic COVID-19,<br> 
          my friends and I have to Open Distances Learning (ODL) <br>
          I learn many new things while I'm studying like patience is very important in any kind of sitution..We must know how to adapt with it  <br>
          I also must always follow  to the schedule to ensure that I do not miss the track while learning. <br>
          I  need to be responsible to my work like must do all the works given by the lecture and must submit all the assignment on time eventhough it is odl.<br>

      When I was studying at UiTM Machang, I am taking program BA119 â€“ Diploma in Banking. <br>
      It is the first program that I choose after my result SPM came out. <br>
      My dream is to be Banking Manager. <br>
      I studied for 5 semesters which is 2 and half years. <br>
      My CGPA in Diploma was 3.57. I will try my best to get better CGPA in Degree. Insyaallah. <br>
      I learn on how to be an independent woman. <br>
      Before this , my parents always with me but when I further my studies in diploma I need to be independent because I'm far away with my family. <br>
      I need to do all the thing alone and I must be responsible of myself. <br>
       At there, I need to adapt with the new environment and meet a new friend..I make a lot of friend.. <br>
      Thanks to all my friends in UiTM Machang. You guys are the best. You guys are important to me. Without you guys, I do not know how I will I finished my studies <br>
      I hope that I can see you all again. I really miss you, but I know that it will be very hard because each of us has a new responsible.

        I graduated from this school in 2016. <br>
        I spent 5 years studying in this school from 2012-2016. <br>
        At this moment, I still searching for who I am. <br>
        I am a normal teenager that wanted everything and easily give up when I fail. <br>
        That is who I am back then. Now I know what I want in my life <br>
        In secondary school, I am pure science student but at the same time  I also took an accounting subject. <br>
        All of my friend took only 9 subject but I took 10 subject.. It is because I like accounting subject. I do my best to complete my study so that I can get a flying colour result in my SPM. <br>
        In my secondary school I have many friends and most of them are very kind with me <br>
        I am very happy because my surrounding full of very kind person. <br>
        In the school, my teachers always give the motivation and support me in academic same as my friend, they always help me in my studies <br>
        Without them I will not able to study until degree. <br>

          I have been studying in this school for 6 years from 2006 - 2011. <br>
          There are some memories that I will never forget while I was studying here. <br>
          This is where I started to learn A, B, C and 123  <br>
          I start to know many thing when I was in SKK. <br>
          Starting this school, I learned to be more disciplined. <br>
          The variety of teachers I learned. For example there are good teachers, fierce and assertive. <br>
          The fierce teacher I feared the most while I was in this school. <br>
          The first time I got scolded for not finishing school, I came home crying. <br>
          It's normal for an 7 year old child. hIHIHI
